Magnuson is based in Ventura, California and has over 40 years of experience making superchargers. Magnuson superchargers are sold in the U.S., Australia, South Africa, Canada, the Middle East, Asia, Mexico and South America. Superchargers and turbochargers are two ways of delivering air to the intake of an internal combustion engine to increase power and efficiency. A supercharger is driven by the crank and a turbocharger is driven by exhaust gases. Unlike a turbo, a supercharger adds instant torque and linear power, making a v6 engine feel like a v8 engine, and 4 cylinder engines feel like 6 cylinders. Combined with Direct Injection and smaller displacement, supercharging helps automobile manufacturers like Audi, Jaguar, Volvo, and GM meet increasingly stringent fuel economy and emissions standards without sacrificing power and drivability. Magnuson Products is an Eaton partner and innovator in supercharging. Magnuson works with OE customers like Toyota, GM, and Lotus to design and build production superchargers for a wide variety of engine sizes and form factors.
