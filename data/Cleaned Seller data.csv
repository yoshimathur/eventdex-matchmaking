Magnuson superchargers are sold in the U.S., Australia, South Africa, Canada, the Middle East, Asia, Mexico and South America. Superchargers and turbochargers are two ways of delivering air to the intake of an internal combustion engine to increase power and efficiency. A supercharger is driven by the crank and a turbocharger is driven by exhaust gases. Unlike a turbo, a supercharger adds instant torque and linear power, making a v6 engine feel like a v8 engine, and 4 cylinder engines feel like 6 cylinders. Combined with Direct Injection and smaller displacement, supercharging helps automobile manufacturers like Audi, Jaguar, Volvo, and GM meet increasingly stringent fuel economy and emissions standards without sacrificing power and drivability. Magnuson Products is an Eaton partner and innovator in supercharging. Magnuson works with OE customers like Toyota, GM, and Lotus to design and build production superchargers for a wide variety of engine sizes and form factors.

Unlike other lawyers or leadership consultants, I have both business and legal experience and that lets me help you engineer an integrated strategy to build a smarter and more robust organization -- one whose M.O., or way of doing things, you can be proud of.","Teaching is at the heart of what we do. Business M.O. helps you embed more legal literacy into your company’s DNA to support profitable business growth. We accomplish this in 3 ways: leadership development, legal resource management, and keynote speaking. Leadership development programs can be tailored to your specific needs with on-site workshops scheduled for half-day, full-day, or lunch and learn sessions. Customization of our existing e-learning programs is another option. Company specific examples and branding personalize your employees’ experience, improves the learning process, and reinforces your message. Legal resource management for the purpose of uncovering cost savings opportunities involves review of how your business buys, manages, and uses legal services.
